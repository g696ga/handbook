# Start & finish times

You'll agree hours with your line manager when you start. You must stick to them; late arrivals are usually noted, and HR will take an interest in repeat offenders.

Your arrival time is when you're at your desk. Your finish time is when you close down your computer.

We trust you, and we won't be fastidious about times. Feel free to make the odd tea when you get in, or stretch your legs. But as a rule, we require focus during operating hours â€“ and for you to unwind when you leave. Overworking is a false economy.
