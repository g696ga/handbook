To run the business, we need our people in place and available at the times we expect. All of our rules about absence surround this principle.

## Asking for time off

When you need time off, the best person to speak with is your manager. They'll work out a plan and let you know if any evidence needs to be handed in. Remember, if you're off-site, you must call (don't email). In exceptional circumstances, your manager may not be able to give you any time off if you need it; but they will try to be flexible, and you can appeal to HR if required.

## Absent Without Leave

If your absence doesn't meet the criteria for a type of time off, you are Absent Without Leave (AWL). Being AWL results in disciplinary action. You could also be AWL if you don't tell us in advance, in the right way, or after supplying the right documents.

## Types of time off

Your time off will be one of the following types, depending on why you were off (the **criteria**):

| Type | Criteria |
| --- | --- |
| Administrative | We suspend you with pay pending investigation |
| Adoptive | You are adopting **+** |
| Bereavement | A close relative died |
| Civic | You were called up for Jury Duty, to sit on a Children's Panel, etc. **U** |
| Compassionate | A close relative is critically ill |
| Dependants | Your child (or ward, if you're a carer) has an emergency, like falling ill **+** **U** |
| Flexibility | You ask your manager to take time off, or work part-time, for up to a few weeks **U** |
| Garden | We tell you not to work or contact anyone when working notice |
| Holiday | Requested time off in advance via holiday form, and no other types apply |
| Incapacity | You are too ill or injured to work, and you call us in advance |
| Maternity | You are with child **+** |
| Obsequies | You need extra Bereavement Leave because you are the funeral planner |
| Parental | You want extra time off after Maternity, Paternity, or Adoptive **+** **U** |
| Paternity | Your significant other is having a child **+** |
| Remedial | A disciplinary panel suspends you without pay for misconduct |
| Shared Parental | Your significant other transfers some of their parental leave from their employer to us **+** |
| Training | We send you on a training course or for further education |

**+**: To use these types of time off, you'll need to follow additional processes to help us collect the information required by the government. See our separate handbook pages, or speak to HR.
**U**: This type of time off is unpaid. (Some types of time off without this notation may still be at reduced pay.)
