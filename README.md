# G69 Handbook

This team handbook sets out basic policies about how we should and do operate. We try to only include interesting, relevant issues â€“ and to speak about them as quickly as possible.

If you have questions about this handbook, speak to your line manager. This handbook can't deal with every eventuality; if it's silent on something, we'll make case-by-case decisions.
