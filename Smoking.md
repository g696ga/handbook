# Smoking

Smoking causes 1% of all sickdays, and smoke contains 4,000 chemicals which cause 50 known cancers. It is not permitted in or near our property.

We are a smoke-free workplace. It is illegal to consume tobacco or vapour products inside our building or at its perimeter. The binstore is the closest point to indoors where you may smoke, and the front door for vaping.

If you wish to take a smoke break, you must do so on your scheduled lunch. You may not take up our time on this habit, and we will deal with you severely if you do so.

# Help to quit

Assistance to quit smoking for good is available. After signing up to a Quitting program with the NHS, we'll provide you paid time off to pop off to appointments within working hours. And we'll buy you a thank you if you successfully complete the program.

Please tell your manager before you start to quit. This will prime them to provide you time off for appointments (if applicable) and let your co-workers encourage you.
